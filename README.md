# Clash-RC-Round-2

# Update 03

Guys, It's time to start working vigorously on this project.

I NEED CONTRIBUTION FOR ALL OF YOU!

please, don't fear to commit in git repo, if something goes wrong seniors and teammates are there to help us. And be active on whatsapp group, you can text me or senior anytime if you face any error in code

I will be distributing work and adding new members in each teams. These are the following points that were disscussed in today's meet. 

 --> Updating and adding new fields in UserProfile, Questions and Submission
 --> add functions compile, runTestCase and compare in views.py
 --> adding load buffer button(using AJAX for refreshing page) in the coding page
 --> working on leaderboard's logic.
 --> saving, Compiling and testing code.

So, As discussed in our team meet, we have to work on our logic for connecting Models.py and views.py so that it can work properly.

As discussed we are creating a new team who will work on views.py and try to connect and implement the logic of the compilation, testing, load buffer.The members are of the teams with there work are:

1) Views.py      (implement the logic of various functions)
    
   - Gaurav  (Adding load buffer button and logic of it using AJAX)
   - Sanchit (Build logic to save submission whenever the user click submit)
   - Rutuja  (to add compile function in views.py)
   - Yash    (to add compile function in views.py)
   
2) Models.py     (Will work on data storing and compliation of the cpp files)
   
   - Gaurav  (connecting userProfile and Submission using foreign keys)
   - Abhishek(add needed fields into Questions and makemigrations of all)
   - pranav  (add needed fields into UserProfile)
   - Nikhil  (add needed fields into UserProfile)

II) Os and Subprocess modules (Will work on data storing and compliation of the cpp files)
   
   - Sanket  ()
   - Prerna  ()
   - Murtuza ()
   - Shreya  ()
   - Ram     ()

Working with views.py and os/subprocess modules are interconnected to each other so we all have to work together and stay connected for understanding whole code of the project! it's important to understand all Code!!

KEEP PUSHING YOUR CODE IN GITHUB REPO.!

   - Sets the new remote
 
   $ git remote -v
   - Verifies the new remote URL
   
5) $ git pull origin master
   Then pull the all code into the round2 folder from the GitHub
   
Bofore making commit append the list below which you can find in round2 folder as a readme.md, So that I can understand you have completed and set the git by following all 9 steps correctly.
